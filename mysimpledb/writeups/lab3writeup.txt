Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator
2. Aggreagte, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project
3. Select, project, join -- not cross product, union, intersection, difference
4. Filter is a subclass of Operator and Operator already has hasNext() and next() defined. 
5.  
while IterR.hasNext():
	Tuple t = IterR.next()
	if t.name matches "Alice":
		return t
return null

6.
list = []
while IterR.hasNext():
	Tuple t1 = IterR.next()
	while IterS.hasNext():
		Tuple t2 = IterS.next()
		if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
			tNew = merge(t1, t2)
			list.append(tNew)
	IterS.rewind()
return list

7.
while:
	if not IterS.hasNext() or t1 equals null:
		if IterR.hasNext():
			t1 = IterR.next()
			IterS.rewind()
		else: //gone through all tuples
			return null
	while IterS.hasNext():		
		t2 = IterS.next()
		if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
			tNew = merge(t1, t2)
			return tNew
