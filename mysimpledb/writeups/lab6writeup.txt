Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    Logging is done in BufferPool.java when we're flushing a page, and in Transaction.java when we begin, commit, or abort a transaction.

2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    It's called after a log is written when a page flushed in BufferPool.flushPage().
    It is also called inside LogFile.logCommit, LogFile.logAbort, and LogFile.logCheckpoint.
    This is because we want the log to be flushed to disk before the transaction is completed.

3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    It's called in BufferPool.transactionComplete() for every page that the specified transaction has a lock on.

Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?
